        <h2>But beware of her hugs, she can squeeze you to death. If you don't believe, ask Shreya.</h2>
        <h2>She is extremely weird and sometimes scary, you have been warned. (said by Prakruti)</h2>
        <h2>And this girl is great in studies, basketball, singing, dance, giving evil looks. She likes to read books (though she never listened to us when we told her to read Harry Potter books instead of watching the movies.)</h2>
        <h2>She has a habit of giving twisted answers. She can never ever give straight answers.</h2>
        <h2>And I am not going to write anything good about her otherwise she will go on reminding us that how good she is. So let's not talk about that.</h2>
        <h2>But, however she is, she will always remain our bestie!</h2>
